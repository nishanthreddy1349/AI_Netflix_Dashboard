🎬 AI-Powered Streaming Analytics Dashboard

🔗 Live demo: [Add your Streamlit link]

An end-to-end project demonstrating how AI can act as an intelligence layer on top of analytics systems — helping users understand what changed and why, directly inside a dashboard.

🧠 The Problem

Dashboards show numbers.
Humans still do the interpretation.

As data scales, this gap becomes a bottleneck.

This project explores how AI can close that gap by explaining analytics in context.
